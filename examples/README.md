* **generate_tangent_images.py**: Turns an equirectangular images into tangent image patches
* **visualize_icosphere_sampling.py**: Visualizes tangent images alongside the icosahedron as well as the sampling points on the sphere
* **create_tangent_image_obj**: Write an OBJ file of tangent images textured with the data from an equirectangular image
