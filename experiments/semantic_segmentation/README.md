# Semantic Segmentation and Network Transfer

## Results

Tangent images allow us to scale to high resolution spherical inputs, enabling significant accuracy gains.

...results coming soon...


## Dataset
For these experiments, we used the [Stanford2D3DS dataset](http://buildingparser.stanford.edu/dataset.html) and the OmniSynthia dataset from [Zhang *et al.* (ICCV 2019)](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/papers/Zhang_Orientation-Aware_Semantic_Segmentation_on_Icosahedron_Spheres_ICCV_2019_paper.pdf). You can request access to Stanford2D3DS from its [GitHub page](https://github.com/alexsax/2D-3D-Semantics). Unfortunately, OmniSYNTHIA has not been publicly released. We suggest reaching out to the authors if you desire access.
